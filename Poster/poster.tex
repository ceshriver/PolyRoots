\headerbox{The $1-D$ Operator}{name=TL,column=0,span=2,below=BG}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{multicols}{2}
\large
\noindent The $1-D$ operator, where $D=\frac{d}{dx}$, is a linear map on the set of real-rooted polynomials. It was of particular interest in a recent paper solving the Kadison-Singer conjecture, in part because of its relation to the Laguerre polynomials. We focus primarily on its effect on the differences between the roots of a polynomial.

\end{multicols}

\headerbox{Intuitive Picture}{name=TC,column=0,span=2,below=TL}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{multicols}{2}
\large
\noindent Given a polynomial $f$, the roots of ${(1-D)f}$ can be understood as the points of equilibrium in a system of forces resulting from placing a unit charge at each of the roots of $f$ and introducing a constant gravitational force in the $-x$ direction. This is shown in the figure below.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/charges}
\end{center}
The blue line represents the force at $x$ due to only the blue roots, the red line shows the force due to the red root, and the purple line shows their sum. The red arrow shows where the red root repels the old solutions.

This model makes it easy to see the effects of changing the roots of a polynomial, which can be very useful for bounding various quantities. The intuition provided can often be formalized into a more rigorous argument, as was done for Theorem~\ref{thm:rootgaps} below.

\headerbox{Main Results}{name=BL,column=0,row=3,span=2,below=TC}{
\begin{multicols}{2}
\large
\noindent Our main result for this operator is
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:rootgaps}
	For any real-rooted polynomial $f$, the difference between any two roots of ${(1-D)^n f}$ approaches infinity as $n$ approaches infinity.
\end{theorem}
Interestingly, however, in a more relative sense the roots tend to be close together:

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:rootratio}
	For any polynomial $f$, the ratio of any two roots of ${(1-D)^n f}$ approaches $1$ as $n$ approaches infinity.
\end{theorem}

\noindent and let $\underline{d} = 1\cdot v_1+2\cdot v_2+3\cdot v_3$. Then
$$r^{alg}(G,\underline{d}) < r_G(\underline{d})\text{.}$$
Moreover, after subdividing the edges of $G$, the inequality remains strict, thus providing a counter example for the case of a simple graph.
