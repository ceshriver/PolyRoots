\begin  {question} 
The motivating question for my project is: ``can I make a good poster?"
\end {question}

\noindent A poster should not contain too much text -- this is not a good place for your proofs, and pseudocode, it is a gadget that has just enough to point at so you can effectively and crisply explain the essence of your ideas: the problem, some examples, perhaps counterexamples, an approach to a solution, good illustrations.

\begin{definition}
A poster $P$ is said to be \textit{good} if it satisfies all the properties of being good, and is a poster. 
\end{definition}

Our first main result is an existence result.
\begin{theorem}
There exist at most finitely many good posters. 
\end{theorem}

The best posters contain large amounts of mathematical content. This may include equations such as

$$r^{alg}(G,\underline{d}) < r_G(\underline{d})\text{.}$$
Moreover, after subdividing the edges of $G$, the inequality remains strict, thus providing a counter example for the case of a simple graph.
